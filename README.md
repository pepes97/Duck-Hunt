## Introduction
We decided to develop a 3D version of “Duck Hunt”, a famous game from the 80s, in which the objective is to hit as many ducks as possible.  We designed the scene as a first-person game, where the player is located in a tall grass field and controls a rifle.  Thanks to the help of his dog, that frighten the ducks hidden in the tall grass, the hunt can start. The game ends when the player miss five ducks. In addition,  our game provides other functionalities like enable and disable sounds, pause the game or restart it.

## How to play
1. Move your mouse on the screen to move the rifle
2. Click to shoot
3. Hit as many ducks as possible

You have 5 available errors; when you miss 5 ducks the game is over.

Use <b>P</b> to pause the game and <b>V</b> to able/disable the volume or the corresponding buttons.
